    Write an algorithm that reads a real number x, an integer number n and real coefficients "ai" of a polynomium p(x) = a0 x0 + a1 x1 + x2 x2 . . . an−1 xn−1. And calculate the value of the given polynomium I.e: if x = 2, n = 3 and their coefficients are 2, -1, 3, the polynomium is p(x) = 2 -x + 3x² , and should write the value 12
